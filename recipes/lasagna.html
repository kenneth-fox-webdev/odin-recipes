    <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a classic Italian dish known for its rich layers of pasta,
      savory meat sauce, creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese, and melty
      mozzarella. Believed to have originated from the Emilia-Romagna region of
      Italy, this comforting dish has become a beloved staple in kitchens around
      the world. Traditional lasagna combines sheets of pasta with a hearty
      Bolognese sauce, typically made with ground beef or pork simmered in
      tomatoes, garlic, onions, and Italian herbs. The layers are nestled
      between smooth cheese fillings, topped with grated Parmesan, and baked
      until bubbling and golden brown. The balance of textures and flavors—from
      the slightly crisp top layer to the tender, saucy center—makes lasagna
      both satisfying and indulgent.

      While many variations exist, the essential spirit of lasagna lies in its
      slow-cooked richness and generous layering. It’s a dish often reserved for
      special occasions or family gatherings, not only because of its hearty
      nature but also due to the love and patience required in its preparation.
      Each layer builds upon the next, blending flavors and creating a cohesive
      and deeply flavorful meal. Whether served with a side of garlic bread or a
      simple salad, lasagna is a meal that brings people together and leaves a
      lasting impression of warmth and home-cooked comfort.
