    <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a classic Italian dish known for its rich layers of pasta,
      savory meat sauce, creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese, and melty
      mozzarella. Believed to have originated from the Emilia-Romagna region of
      Italy, this comforting dish has become a beloved staple in kitchens around
      the world. Traditional lasagna combines sheets of pasta with a hearty
      Bolognese sauce, typically made with ground beef or pork simmered in
      tomatoes, garlic, onions, and Italian herbs. The layers are nestled
      between smooth cheese fillings, topped with grated Parmesan, and baked
      until bubbling and golden brown. The balance of textures and flavors—from
      the slightly crisp top layer to the tender, saucy center—makes lasagna
      both satisfying and indulgent.

      While many variations exist, the essential spirit of lasagna lies in its
      slow-cooked richness and generous layering. It’s a dish often reserved for
      special occasions or family gatherings, not only because of its hearty
      nature but also due to the love and patience required in its preparation.
      Each layer builds upon the next, blending flavors and creating a cohesive
      and deeply flavorful meal. Whether served with a side of garlic bread or a
      simple salad, lasagna is a meal that brings people together and leaves a
      lasting impression of warmth and home-cooked comfort.

    <h2>Steps to Make Lasagna</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>Prepare the Meat Sauce</h3>
        <p>
          In a large saucepan or skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat.
          Add the chopped onion and sauté for 5–6 minutes until soft and
          translucent. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for 1 more minute
          until fragrant. Add the ground beef, breaking it apart with a spoon,
          and cook until browned and no longer pink. Drain excess fat if
          necessary.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Simmer the Sauce</h3>
        <p>
          Stir in the tomato paste and let it cook for 1–2 minutes to deepen the
          flavor. Add the crushed tomatoes, sugar, oregano, basil, red wine (if
          using), salt, and pepper. Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce
          simmer uncovered for 30–45 minutes, stirring occasionally until
          thickened. Adjust seasoning to taste. Optional: Add chopped fresh
          herbs for a burst of flavor.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Cook the Noodles (if not using oven-ready)</h3>
        <p>
          While the sauce simmers, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
          Cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions until al
          dente. Drain and lay them flat on a towel or parchment paper to
          prevent sticking.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Prepare the Cheese Filling</h3>
        <p>
          In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, grated Parmesan,
          chopped parsley, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Mix until smooth and
          set aside.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Assemble the Lasagna</h3>
        <p>
          Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Spread a thin layer of meat sauce
          on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Add a layer of noodles, then
          spread a portion of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles.
          Sprinkle with a bit of mozzarella, then spoon over more meat sauce.
          Repeat the layers—noodles, ricotta, mozzarella, meat sauce—until all
          ingredients are used, finishing with a generous layer of sauce and the
          remaining mozzarella and Parmesan on top.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Bake</h3>
        <p>
          Cover the dish with foil (tenting it so it doesn’t touch the cheese)
          and bake for 25 minutes. Then remove the foil and bake uncovered for
          another 20–25 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly. Let it
          rest for at least 15 minutes before slicing to help the layers set.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Serve and Enjoy</h3>
        <p>
          Garnish with fresh parsley or basil if desired. Serve with a side
          salad or garlic bread for a complete meal. Leftovers can be stored in
          the refrigerator for up to 4 days or frozen for longer storage.
