    <h2>Steps for Cheeseburger Recipe</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>Prepare the patties</h3>
        <p>
          In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef with salt, pepper, and
          optional garlic/onion powder. Gently mix with your hands—avoid
          overmixing to keep the burgers tender. Divide the mixture into 4 equal
          portions and form into patties about ¾ inch thick. Press a small
          dimple into the center of each patty with your thumb to prevent
          puffing during cooking.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Toast the buns</h3>
        <p>
          Heat a skillet or griddle over medium heat. Spread a small amount of
          butter on the cut sides of each bun. Place the buns cut side down on
          the skillet until golden brown (1–2 minutes). Remove and set aside.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Cook the patties</h3>
        <p>
          Increase the heat to medium-high. Place the patties on the hot skillet
          or grill. Cook for 3–4 minutes on the first side, then flip. After
          flipping, add a slice of cheese to each patty and cover the pan with a
          lid (or close the grill) to help the cheese melt. Cook for another 3–4
          minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 160°F (71°C) for
          well-done.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Assemble the burgers</h3>
        <p>
          Spread condiments on the toasted buns as desired. Layer the lettuce,
          tomato, onion, and pickles (if using) on the bottom bun. Place the
          cooked patty with melted cheese on top of the toppings, then crown
          with the top bun.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Serve</h3>
        <p>
          Serve immediately with your favorite sides—fries, chips, or a fresh
          salad. Enjoy your homemade cheeseburger masterpiece!
