    <h2>Steps to Make Chicken and Dumplings</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>Sauté the vegetables</h3>
        <p>
          In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil or butter over medium
          heat. Add the onion, carrots, and celery. Cook for 5–6 minutes until
          softened. Add the garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Build the soup base</h3>
        <p>
          Pour in the chicken broth and stir in the salt, pepper, thyme, and bay
          leaf. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and let it simmer for 10
          minutes to blend flavors.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Add chicken and cream</h3>
        <p>
          Stir in the cooked shredded chicken and the optional heavy cream or
          milk if using. Let the soup continue to simmer while you prepare the
          dumplings.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Make the dumplings</h3>
        <p>
          In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt. Add
          the milk and melted butter and stir just until combined—a thick,
          sticky dough will form.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Add dumplings to the pot</h3>
        <p>
          Drop spoonfuls of dough (about 1 tablespoon each) directly onto the
          simmering soup. Cover the pot with a lid and simmer for 15 minutes
          without lifting the lid. The steam will cook the dumplings until
          they’re soft and fluffy.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Finish and serve</h3>
        <p>
          Remove the bay leaf. Taste the broth and adjust seasoning if needed.
          Garnish with fresh parsley and serve hot.
